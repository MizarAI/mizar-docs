# Abstract

Mizar is a smart trading platform that enables beginners to profit from the wisdom of their peers. A two-sided marketplace allows novices to copy-trade from profitable pros who in turn can monetize their skills. Automated trading, strategy sharing, and code-free bot creation are all integrated into a user-friendly yet feature-rich interface. And because there are zero monthly subscription fees, no one is priced out of using Mizar.

Designed to drive down the barriers to growing crypto wealth, Mizarâ€™s copy-trading marketplace is complemented by advanced analytics, leaderboards, and an incentivized staking program.

The $MZR token aligns incentives, delivering lower fees, facilitating governance and fostering a robust ecosystem that rewards contributors commensurate with their efforts. In doing so, Mizar will democratize crypto investment, enabling everyone to access the tools for obtaining financial independence.

As Mizar rolls out its multi-phase roadmap, users will be able to trade across dozens of CEX and DEX platforms from a single terminal. The introduction of AI to support better decision-making and enhanced analytics will allow users to derive greater success from DCA, API or GRID bots and to automate order creation and execution. As a result, beginners can tap into powerful trading tools that are normally only accessible to professionals with a low barrier to entry.

With a focus on design, reliability, and transparency, Mizar represents a quantum leap over incumbent trading platforms. The ability to set different order types and filter strategies by risk and profitability supports a circular economy in which everyone can prosper.
