# Allocate Capital

Mizar offers the possibility for quants and investors to come together to invest in algorithmic trading strategies. This is achieved through Mizar's marketplace, a place where investors can search and compare algo-trading strategies and allocate some capital to mirror the strategies.

To allocate some capital, follow these steps:

{% endhint %}
