Mizar offers the possibility for traders and investors to come together to invest in common trading strategies. This is achieved through the Mizar marketplace, a place where investors can search and compare trading strategies and allocate some capital to mirror the strategy performance.

Visit the marketplace and find your favourite strategy.
