# Auto-compounding

Compounding is the process in which an asset's earnings, from either capital gain or interest, are reinvested to generate additional earnings over time. This growth, calculated using exponential functions, occurs because the investment will generate earnings from both its initial principal and the accumulated earnings from preceding periods. Compounding, therefore, differs from linear growth, where only the principal earns interest each period.

### DCA Bots

When auto-compounding is activated, the assets allocated to the DCA bot increase with the profits. The auto-compounding will update the safety and base order sizes based on the previous day profit.

In case of losses, the auto-compounding won't update the allocation and the orders sizes.&#x20;
