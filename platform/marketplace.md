# Marketplace

Mizar offers on its platform a marketplace where traders and investors can come together to invest in the most performing trading strategies. After being authenticated through Twitter, traders  will be able to publish their trading strategy and share it with other investors in order to get rewarded based on the monthly performance. Quants will have to authenticate themselves to be allowed to publish strategies.

Investors can search for trading strategies published by traders and decide whether they wish to invest their capital into that strategy. Investors will be able to compare multiple strategies with each other based on live performance, trader's reputation, trader fee and other indicators.
