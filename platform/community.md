# Community

Mizar is not only a trading platform but a real community of financial enthusiasts and developers. 

Investors will have the opportunity to exchange thoughts, ideas, strategies, and more with quants and algo-traders. Users will have the possibility to write comments on strategies or rate them, ask questions to quants or suggest improvements.

### Rewarding Contributions

MizarLabs is an open-source tool, that means free for everyone to use, explore, and get involved with. Investors, developers, users, and everybody else will have the chance to give their contribution and get part of something big by improving the platform, solving bugs, or proposing new features. In the future, contributions will be rewarded through MZR \(see [MZR Utility token](../whitepaper/mzr-utility-token/)\). 

Mizar will be also the best place where everyone, no matter the level of know-how and experience, can learn more about algo-trading or blockchain, grow skills and eventually publish the best strategy on the marketplace. 

### Leaderboard

All algo-traders that are trading live on the platform are ranked monthly based on their live performance.  The performance will be assessed based on several metrics such as total returns, maximum draw-down, Sharpe ratio, hit rate, etc... Based on their ranking the algo-traders will be rewarded with MZR, and additionally, they can earn badges which are shown on their profile page.
