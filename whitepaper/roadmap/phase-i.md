# Phase I

**Phase one** will be reached upon completion of the following steps:

**Smart Trading Terminal**&#x20;

Currently under development, the terminal is where traders can manually open positions by adding smart trading tools such as set multi-entries, use stop loss, multi-take profit and more.

**$MZR Token Launch and Integration**&#x20;

From day one, traders will be able to stake $MZR in the Mizar platform to access discounts and benefits.

**Mizar Social Trading**&#x20;

Mizar’s social component will be enhanced by opening the marketplace to everyone and introducing improved metrics, adding ratings and reviews, and rolling out competitions and leaderboard.

**Grid Bots**&#x20;

Mizar’s third bot type will see the introduction of grid bots. Grid bots are designed to make a profit on a sideways (flat) market by trading between multiple order levels (‘grid’). These bots help traders to profit when the price is fluctuating in a tight range, simply by opening and closing trades repeatedly.
