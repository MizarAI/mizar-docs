### Investor

Investors can invest in algo-trading strategies published by algo-traders by subscribing to them on the marketplace. After subscribing to a strategy and allocating capital to it, the strategy will automatically open and close positions for the investors. 

#### Trading Fees

Strategies will open and close positions for investors and each time a trade is executed either by opening or closing a position the investor pays a trading fee to Mizar for monitoring their position and executing their trades.

#### Performance Fees

Investors pay a performance fee on a monthly basis to the algo-trader for developing a profitable strategy. The performance fee is set by the algo-trader and is disclosed to the investor beforehand. A portion of the performance fee is paid to the platform as described[ here]().

#### Holding MZR

The investor can hold MZR to receive a discount on the trading fees. Depending on the amount of MZR the investor holds the discount increases. For more information click [here]().
