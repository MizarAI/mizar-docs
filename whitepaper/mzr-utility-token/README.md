# MZR Utility Token

Traders will be able to mirror algorithmic trading strategies of quants through a marketplace by using Mizar's utility token, **MZR**, as a way to reward algo-traders and to maintain the trading infrastructure of Mizar. 

**Fee reduction**

Investors and Algo-Traders who hold a certain amount of **MZR** will receive a reduction in trading fees, for information please click [here]().

**Algo-Traders**

Algo-traders will be able to research and backtest algo-strategies through the Mizar Labs open-source libraries. Algo-traders can eventually share their algo-trading strategies in the marketplace. Algo-trading strategies can be made public or private by the algo-traders.

Algo-traders will be required to either hold a certain **MZR** amount or have a certain level of profitability in order to access more advanced data and tools.
