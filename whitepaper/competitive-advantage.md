# How Mizar Works

The Mizar marketplace is where traders can share strategies with other investors and earn rewards based on realized performance. It’s also where they showcase their portfolio and go up against the best traders in the world. The marketplace brings together traders and investors to exchange the best performing strategies and increase portfolio size.

Users can search for strategies published by traders based on a variety of metrics and invest in those that fit their desired performance and risk profile. Multiple strategies can be compared based on live performance, trader's reputation, trader fee, as well as other key performance indicators all in one place.

Bots that can be developed and sold on the Mizar marketplace include:

DCA Bots Traders can develop Dollar Cost Average bots without needing to write a single line of code. Such bots reduce the need to time the market perfectly, reducing the pressure to buy the dip or sell the top.

A DCA bot automatically buys or sells a currency at preset intervals with the goal of improving the entry price of a trade over time. On Mizar, anyone can access the power of DCA bots in just a few clicks.

API Bots Traders can develop API bots that plug into third party exchanges including CEX and DEX. Using Mizar’s trading infrastructure to automate their signals, they can quickly respond to market movements and harness leading indicators to good effect.

Smart Trading Traders can manually open orders on different exchanges or pairs, using Mizar’s smart functionality to reduce risk. This includes features such as multi-entry zones (i.e. buy at different prices and times) and multi-take profit and trailing to secure profits when the market moves up or stop loss when it moves down.

Phase II

All of the features detailed above will be implemented into the Mizar platform upon launch. The next release, known as Phase II, will see Mizar enhanced with a host of new features.

This major upgrade will focus on two important components: analytics and DEX trading.

Analytics: Analytics help users learn from past trades and make smarter decisions. Mizar Analytics will provide access to sophisticated trading data. This includes data derived from the web such as sentiment sentiment analysis as well as technical data (volume, price, liquidity). On-chain data from leading analytics providers such as Nansen will also be integrated into the Mizar dashboard..

Bot/Position Manager: Users will be able to create their own KPIs and triggers to fully or semi-automatically manage their bots (e.g. timing, position size, exit strategy). They can also do the same with their positions (e.g. when to take profit or add more funds to a single position). The creation of custom triggers allows users to call the shots with their bots, deciding when and how to act upon specific market conditions.

Mizar AI Mizar will develop advanced Artificial Intelligence models to help traders make better decisions. Through the use of machine learning and AI, traders can optimize their strategy settings based on the latest AI models. Additionally, Mizar will build an AI-driven ranking mechanism for strategy analysis. This can be used to evaluate profitability against risk, to forecast the success ratio of custom-made signals, and even to identify suitable portfolio strategies to allocate capital.

DEX Trading: DEX trading plays a pivotal role in Mizar’s evolution. Smart trading will be rolled out on dYdX initially, giving DEX traders a product that’s tailor made for their needs and reactive to the rigors of onchain order execution. After bringing copy-trading to dYdX, Uniswap will become the second DEX to be integrated as part of Phase II.
