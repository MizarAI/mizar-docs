# Galaxy Fund

Currently, only large players can invest in Hedge Funds or advanced investment vehicles. This is normally linked to high ticket size and exclusive access.

Mizar is aiming to open Hedge Fund services to everyone by making it accessible, transparent, and non-custodian.

Investors can provide liquidity in the Mizar Liquidity Pool and take part to the Galaxy Fund performance.

Mizar reinvests part of its revenues into the Galaxy Fund, composed by the top trading strategies of the marketplace. Part of the monthly profits generated by the Galaxy Fund will be used to buy tokens and use them to incentivize Liquidity Providers.
