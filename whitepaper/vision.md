# Vision

Mizar's vision is to make algo-trading easily accessible for everyone. Mizar's aims to become the main marketplace for investors and traders, where they can come together to invest in algorithmic trading strategies.

Mizar's strategy is to provide a platform for our users to develop, backtest, deploy and attract capital for their algorithmic trading strategies, which address the current issues in the algorithmic trading space. 

Our platform will lower the barriers to entry for investors and traders. Investors can search and invest their capital in successful trading algorithms, which have been objectively backtested to assess their performance. Traders can predominantly focus on developing their trading strategy and leverage the Mizar platform to execute and monitor trades automatically.
