# Vision

Mizar's vision is to make algo-trading easily accessible for everyone. Mizar's aims to become the main marketplace for investors and quants, where they can come together to invest in algorithmic trading strategies.

Mizar's strategy is to provide a platform for our users to develop, backtest, deploy and attract capital for their algorithmic trading strategies, which address the current issues in the algorithmic trading space. 

Our platform will lower the barriers to entry for investors and quants. Investors can search and invest their capital in successful trading algorithms, which have been objectively backtested to assess their performance. Quants can predominantly focus on developing their trading strategy and leverage the Mizar platform to get live data feeds, backtest their strategy, and deploy their strategies on the platform to execute and monitor trades automatically. Mizar is an algorithmic trading platform created by quants for quants.
