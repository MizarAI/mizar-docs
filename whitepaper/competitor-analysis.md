# Competitor Analysis

Mizar aims to become the best smart trading solution on the market. The concept of smart trading, giving novices the ability to generate a return on their investment with minimal oversight, has been established for some time now.

One of the greatest differentiators between Mizar and incumbent solutions is **pricing**. Most smart trading platforms impose some kind of fixed and recurring fee structure. While this structure may be palatable to wealthy users, for other users who intend to commit small amounts of capital, a fixed monthly fee acts as a deterrent.

Mizar eschews the subscription model altogether, with **no monthly or fixed fees required**. This supports onboarding and facilitates a proof-based system in which fees are only deducted from actual trades that are fulfilled. As a result, users can sign up with no initial cost and tap directly into the bots and strategies developed by pro traders.

To bootstrap adoption, Mizar will give new users the ability to trade for free up to a certain volume threshold, with zero fees incurred. It will also enable paper trading so that users can try out the platform without risking their capital.

Furthermore, the use of the $MZR token enables fees to be dramatically reduced by as much as 95%. This provides an incentive structure for regular users, who can maximize their profitability. With Mizar, fees are derived from trading volume and from copy-trading profits. This tiered system makes for a fairer model in which users are not under pressure to generate profits from day one simply to cover their subscription costs.

Mizar’s fee structure has been specified in this way to attract micro-traders who have less capital to deploy. This system is also more effective in driving a circular economy that supports both micro-traders and pros.&#x20;

Mizar’s profit sharing mechanism is a win-win for investors and traders alike. In addition to having no upfront fees to cover, traders are not lumped with any fees over the course of a calendar month if they are not net profitable. This reduces barriers to entry while ensuring that pro traders are fairly compensated for the profits they help fellow traders realize.

Another key differentiator between existing smart trading solutions and Mizar is in terms of design. While existing products are broadly suited to sophisticated users, they have a significant learning curve. This acts as a deterrent to novices, who can not be realistically expected to master a technically demanding interface complete with an advanced and overwhelming array of features.

Although feature-rich, Mizar has been designed with user-friendliness paramount. Attention has been lavished on interface design with the goal of abstracting complexity. The focus is on placing the primary features front and center, ensuring that new users are not overwhelmed by options upon first accessing the Mizar terminal.

Recognizing that a good user experience is about more than quality interface design, Mizar will combine an intuitive UI with professional customer support. This includes 24/7 support through different channels, guides to getting started, a detailed FAQ, and other resources to help users get the most out of Mizar’s smart trading terminal.
