# Team

Mizar was founded by four expert traders, each of whom has a background with leading corporations. Its team is experienced at developing Artificial Intelligence trading solutions and trading various assets and commodities. Having been crypto enthusiasts since 2016, they self-funded Mizar in its early stages with the goal of bringing advanced institutional tools to the crypto space.

Since then, Mizar has grown to over 17 employees worldwide, each of whom is passionate about crypto, trading, and delivering solutions that benefit everyone from beginners to professionals.

Much more than just a crypto trading platform, Mizar is a growing community that embraces differences and makes everyone feel welcome. We aim to foster a supportive environment where users can learn, exchange knowledge, share ideas and make well-informed investment decisions.
