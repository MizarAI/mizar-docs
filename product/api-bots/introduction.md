# Introduction

With API Trading, traders can communicate with Mizar and open/close positions of their strategies directly from their preferred programming language. Additionally, traders can connect their TradingView strategy to Mizar and share it with their followers

Traders will be able to see the performance of their signals with paper trading or to trade directly on their connected exchanges. Furthermore, traders can publish these strategies to the marketplace and get copied by other investors to earn a passive income.
