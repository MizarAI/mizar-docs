# Galaxy Fund

A significant percentage of the feeâ€™s generated through the usage of the Mizar platform will be redirected into the Mizar Galaxy fund, a community-owned fund that will be controlled by a DAO using Mizar tokens for governance.&#x20;



The profits obtained from the Galaxy fund will also be compounded back into the fund, as well as distributed to LP providers. Using the DAO model, Mizar token holders will be able to control which strategies are best for growing the fund and how to distribute the profits.&#x20;

Eventually, Mizar will allow LP token stakers the ability to deposit their own funds into the Galaxy Fund to grow their portfolios along with it.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Galaxy Fund is still under development, changes can be applied over time and the concept of the Fund can be changed.
