# Trading Platform

Mizar is a next-gen trading platform for cryptos for Centralized and Decentralized Exchanges.&#x20;

Mizar gives the opportunity to everyone to get access to advanced trading tools through a user-friendly subscription-free platform. Users can develop different kinds of bots without the need of coding or use smart trading tools to place and manage orders on different exchanges, at the same time, using a variety of metrics, even social ones.&#x20;

Traders  can share their strategies on the marketplace while ranking their portfolios with the community and can open themselves to get copied by others to earn performance fees, while users seeking profitable strategies can copy trade the top performing traders in the marketplace.&#x20;

Mizar is subscription free, that means users will never be asked to pay fixed fee. Each trader will pay on traded volumes (as a traditional Centralized Exchange) or on monthly realized profits when copying other traders. Those holding the $MZR tokens can obtain significant discounts on those fees, up to 95%. Crypto Traders can automate their Centralized and Decentralized trading strategies and finally leave their screens (and emotions) behind, knowing their strategies will be executed with Mizar.
