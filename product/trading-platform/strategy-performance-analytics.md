# BotLabs

Mizar offers to traders of all level professional trading tools to put their cryptos in motion and automate their trades.&#x20;

Traders can use preprogrammed bots, or develop simple and advanced bots, to trade multiple pairs on multiple exchanges at the same time, whether it be SPOT or FUTURES markets. The Mizar team developed a low-latency, safe and secure infrastructure to let traders focus on their main needs: trade, maximizing profits, and minimizing risks.&#x20;

Trading cryptos is difficult and getting harder by the day, with far greater risk than other markets. Unlike traditional markets, **** Crypto trading is 24/7, time-consuming, and requires advanced tech and financial know-how. With Mizar, users can develop their own bots, to help overcome emotions and generate profits from cryptos in any market condition. Using Mizarâ€™s automated bots for centralized and decentralized exchanges also means time away from the screen and allows for one to focus on the other important things in life.

By utilizing BotLabs, users do not have to be expert traders or quants. Mizar developed a user-friendly interface where everyone can use or develop bots simply by a couple of clicks of a mouse, using an unlimited number of indicators to automate trades.
