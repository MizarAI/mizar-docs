# TradingLabs

Mizar is simplifying trading with TradingLabs, so that you can have access to all of your exchanges/portfolios in one place.&#x20;

Traders of all levels can optimize their trading activities by doing it from one single tab, on multiple exchanges and markets, while tracking analytics such as Profits & Loss in what will be the most robust trading platform in crypto.&#x20;

Moreover, traders can get support from automation by setting predefined rules such as ‘take profits’ or ‘stop losses,’ to close a position whenever the target price is reached. This, combined with the BotLabs bots, provides unparalleled automation of trading where you see all the supported exchanges, all in one place, meaning users can analyze their portfolio or execute trades without ever having to change a tab.
