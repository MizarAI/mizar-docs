# Decentralized Exchanges

Mizar vision is to bridge smart and automated-trading tools from CeFi to DeFi. The Mizar team is currently developing advanced solutions to enable users to trade on-chain, integrating the most used DEX available. Whereas centralized exchanges have advanced trading tools, decentralized exchanges have none. Traders have to rely on in-the-moment trades which can still fail and force traders to execute trades manually. Mizar plans to fix this by giving users access to the same tools that are made available on centralized exchanges on decentralized exchanges, propelling decentralized exchanges into the future!
