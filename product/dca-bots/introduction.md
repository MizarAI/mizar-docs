# Introduction

A DCA (or "Dollar Cost Averaging") strategy is the practice of investing into a currency at preset intervals to reduce the entry price of a position over time and mitigate volatility risk. For example, when you enter a position with a lump-sum investment (all-in) you run the risk of purchasing "highs" only to see the price drop and end up with a losing position, that you must choose whether to hold, or cut your investment at a loss. However, if you DCA, you can divide your investment into smaller pieces and buy the asset at various points over time at different prices, thereby getting a better average price for your position and greatly reducing risks from the consequences of volatility.&#x20;

## Example

You have $5,000 and decide to invest $1,000 every 30 days for five months.&#x20;

If prices at the time of each entry were $100, $90, $80, $70 and $95, your average asset price would be the average cost of entry at $85.50.&#x20;

Had you entered the entirety of your investment at the beginning, you would have paid $100 per share, almost 15% more!
