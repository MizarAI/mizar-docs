# Fee Monitoring

Mizar has built a transparent way for its users to monitor their fees and discount at any time

### STAR Level

The STAR level is updated on a daily basis depending on the volume traded over the last 30 days and the current MZR holdings.&#x20;

1. 30D volume: the amount of volume (in $) traded over the last 30 days
2. MZR Holdings: the amount of MZR held in the Mizar wallet
3. Volume fee: the current volume fee applied to each dollar traded
4. Performance Fee Rebate: the current rebate that will be applied to the performance fee of copied strategies

### Fees - Accounting

Check your fees at any time through the Fee Manager Dashboard.&#x20;

Fees are shown per type -- volume and performance -- or per strategy.

{% hint style="info" %}
