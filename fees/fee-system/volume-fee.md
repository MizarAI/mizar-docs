# Volume Fee



With Mizar, users pay a daily volume fee based on how much volume has been traded in that day. The volume fee is detracted each day from the user Mizar wallet.

Mizar applies max 0.075% trading fee on each dollar traded.&#x20;

Each user has right to $10,000 free traded volume, each month.

#### Examples:

1. Trader B has 5 active subscriptions. In total, the bots trade, in one day, $46,000 of volume. In that day, the STAR level of Trader B is "Nebula", which implies a fee of 0.075%. Mizar applies the following volume fee: $46,000 \* 0.075% = $34.5.
2. Trader C has 15 active subscriptions. In total, the bots trade, in one day, $500,000 of volume. In that day, the STAR level of Trader C is "Giant", which implies a fee of 0.023% applied to each traded volume. Mizar applies the following fee: $500,000 \* 0.023% = $115.

{% hint style="info" %}
IMPORTANT: If the users have no available balance in their Mizar wallet nor free volume left, the bots could run in a limited bot and positions could not be opened. Always make sure to have enough balance or free volume to avoid bots running in limited mode. If the wallet is out of capital, the open positions will be closed according to the strategy.
