# Fee system

Mizar wants to open smart trading to everyone. Most of the current trading platforms offer subscription fees that traders have to bear regardless of their capital, usage, expertise, or performance.

Mizar offers to its users an innovative yet simple fee system. Mizar developed a secure wallet system where users can deposit and withdraw stable coins to be used to pay their fees and reward other traders.

At Mizar, there are two different fees mechanisms, depending on the product used.

## Marketplace - performance fee

Users can share successful strategies and bots via a marketplace and get copied by other investors. In this way, traders are rewarded for their innovations while others can benefit from following them.

Traders are free to propose their own performance fee. The performance fee will be applied to the gross profits resulting from the copied strategies, calculated at the end of the calendar month.

On top of the performance fee, Mizar is applying a fee of 10% to the gross profits resulting from the copied strategies, calculated at the end of the calendar month.

The performance fee will be detracted each month from the user deposit.

Example:

**Trader A starts to follow Trader B and copy-trade. The performance fee applied from Trader B is 15%. During the month of August \(from 01.08.21 to 31.08.21\), Trader A performs a total gross profit \(i.e. no fee exchange applied yet\) of 100USDT \(~$100\).**  

**Trader A has to pay the following performance fees:**

* **Performance fee to trader B: 100USDT \* 15%= 15 USDT  ~ $15**
* **Performance fee to Mizar: 100USDT \* 10% = 10USDT ~ $10**

**Trader A is happy and made 75USDT of gross profits in August.**  


## BotLabs and TradingLabs - volume fee 

Users can develop their own bots to automate their trades or simplify their trading activities.

Mizar applies a 0.05% trading fee on each dollar traded. 

To support investors, Mizar offers the first $5,000 of volume traded for free, each month. Trading fees are capped to a maximum of $100 per month.

The performance fee will be detracted each day from the user deposit.

Example:

**Trader A builds a bot and at the end of August. In total, the bot traded in August \(from 01.08.21 to 31.08.21\) $3,000 of volumes. Mizar does not apply any fee to Trader A in August.**

**Trader B  has 5 active bots in August. In total, the bots traded in August \(from 01.08.21 to 31.08.21\) $56,000 of volumes. Mizar applies the following fee:** 

* **Trading fee calculation = \($56,000 - $5,000\) \* 0.05 = $25.5**
* **August trading fee = $25.5**

**Trader C  has 15 active bots in August. In total, the bots traded in August \(from 01.08.21 to 31.08.21\) $1,000,000 of volumes. Mizar applies the following fee:** 

* **Trading fee calculation = \($1,000,000 - $5,000\) \* 0.05 = $497.5 &gt; $100**
* **August trading fee = $100.0**
