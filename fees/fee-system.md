# Fee system

Mizar wants to open smart trading to everyone. Most of the current trading platforms offer subscription fees that traders have to bear regardless of their capital, usage, expertise, or performance.

Mizar offers to its users an innovative yet simple fee system. Mizar developed a secure wallet system where users can deposit and withdraw stable coins to be used to pay their fees and reward other traders.

At Mizar, there are two different fee mechanisms.&#x20;

1. Traders pay a volume fee based on their traded volumes.&#x20;
2. Traders pay a performance fee when copying other traders, based on monthly gross profits.

Fees are be reduced based on traded volume or MZR holdings in the Mizar wallet. Check [here](star-program-fees-reduction.md) for more information.\
