# MizarLabs (COMING SOON)

[Mizar Labs](https://github.com/MizarAI/mizar-labs) is an open-source library containing a set of tools for building advanced algorithmic strategies using the latest research mostly based on the work of [Marcos Lopez de Prado](https://www.quantresearch.org/) in his book [Advances in Financial Machine Learning (2018)](https://www.amazon.com/Advances-Financial-Machine-Learning-Marcos/dp/1119482089). Mizar Labs offers tools from machine learning models designed for time-series predictions to transformers that extract the most useful information from the pricing data.
