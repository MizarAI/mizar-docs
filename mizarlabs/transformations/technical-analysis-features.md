# Technical Analysis Features

In financial machine learning, it is very common to build features based on technical analysis. These features are typically based on candlestick bar information, such as the open, high, low, close, and volume. Mizar Labs has wrapped the popular package [TA-Lib](https://mrjbq7.github.io/ta-lib/) \(150+ indicators\), such that these technical indicators can be easily used within the Mizar API to build models.
